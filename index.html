                    <h4>2018 - 2022</h4>
                    <p>I have been developing a project management tool for an architectural company, designed to
                        replace their clunky spreadsheet based systems with a purpose-built website. The project is in
                        use but still under development. A demo could be provided on request.</p>
                    <p>The project has integrations with Xero's WorkflowMax API, uses AJAX and jQuery with an SQL
                        database, and is built on an HTML, CSS and Javascript stack, with PHP files for automating
                        certain API functions.</p>

                        began in late 2017. We received a grant which enabled us to continue work, but unfortunately
                        COVID forced us to re-evaluate the viability of the product. A placeholder site is in use for
                        now. A development version demo could be provided on request.</p>

                    <p>I attended the Summer of Tech Create Camp in 2021. My group produced a financial management tool
                        called Daily Avocado, an "instant, automatic and visual insight" into your financial spending
                        habits.</p>
                    <p>Our project won the Technical Award for the Create Camp, due to our demo and integration with two

                <ul>
                    <li><b>Reliable</b> - I worked on a data
                        migration project for a billion dollar company, delegated and monitored work
                        done by coworkers in support of that project as well as in maintaining a customer
                        facing website with unrestricted content editing access.</li>
                    <li><b>Flexible and a fast learner</b> - I have self taught several languages, reinterpreted and
                        adapted multiple scripts that were unmaintained for up to two years, and performed
                        estimations and exploratory work for other projects.</li>
                    <li><b>Problem solving</b> - I rely on my intuition to formulate
                        a na√Øve solution to a problem, and then optimize the solution until it is as efficient as
                        possible. I believe this reduces the overhead of attacking a huge problem head on by
                        breaking it into smaller parts which can then be optimized.</li>
